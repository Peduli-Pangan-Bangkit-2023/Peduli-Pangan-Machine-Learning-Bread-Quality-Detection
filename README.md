# Peduli-Pangan-Machine-Learning-Bread-Quality-Detection

## Introduction
This repository contains a predictive model designed to detect the quality of bread to ensure the safety of the food to be consumed. This model uses machine learning techniques to detect consumable food.

## Background.
Indonesia's dependence on food imports weakens its food security and independence, making its population vulnerable to foreign influences. Persistent food wastage exacerbates this problem, causing hunger among many citizens. To address this challenge, we aim to promote food sovereignty in Indonesia through the development of the Peduli Pangan app. This initiative aims to empower individuals, promote fair consumption practices, and uphold social justice within the food sector.

## Problem Statement
Despite Indonesia's abundant natural resources, achieving food sovereignty poses significant challenges. Dependence on food imports and prevalent food wastage perpetuate hunger and vulnerability to external influences. Lack of equitable distribution exacerbates this problem, resulting in social injustice in the food industry.

## Objective
To develop the Peduli Pangan App: Create an easy-to-use app to educate and empower individuals to make informed consumption choices, fostering self-reliance.
Contribute to Food Sovereignty: Through this app, aim to reduce dependence on imports, minimize food waste, and empower local communities to achieve greater food sovereignty.

## Project Focus
This project centers on the development of consumable food detection specifically bread. The system serves as part of the solution to reduce food wastage and support food self-sufficiency in an effort towards greater food sovereignty.

## Dataset
The datasets used for model training and testing are from the website and scrapping bing images. The purpose of this dataset is to develop a model (CNN) to classify the state and type of inputted bread images.
